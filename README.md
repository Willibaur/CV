*As an Engineer I learned that Coding and building robots are my two big passions after my family.*

*So I studied Mechatronics, but some years ago I realized that I needed to learn how to code using the best practices and I went to the best code boot camp.*

*I want to apply everything I learned as Full Stack Web Developer within your company.*


Skills
------
* Using core concepts of OOP such as SOLID, DRY and best practices like TDD, agile and pair programming, I can be part of a team to produce clean, readable and end-to-end tested code.
* Comfortable by using languages Ruby, JavaScript, Java and C++.
* Able to test code thanks to RSpec, Capybara, Selenium, Jasmine, Karma and Protactor.
* If I need applications in need of persisting data I can use Postgres, Firebase and MongoDB.
* For a nice styling in the front end, I can mix HTML5, CSS3 and SCSS.
* Interaction between environments mentioned above thanks to the use of frameworks such as Rails, AngularJS, Sinatra, Node and Firebase.
* For keeping control of hundreds of lines of code and folder structures, source version control using Git and Waffle.io
