================================

&nbsp;

I am a pragmatic professional and technically skilful Test Driven Web Developer with an outstanding ability to learn new skills and quickly adapt to change. An open minded individual with working experience across multiple regions (LATAM & Europe). I have excellent communication skills at all levels and a highly committed individual.

I am a strong team player with the ability to work under pressure in complex environments and to a given project deadlines.

Also, I am a Mechatronic engineer who loves working with mobile robots, advanced maths and artificial intelligence, working with hardware or software is my kind
of legacy and proof that there is no boundaries for my mind.

I firmly believe that knowledge has no limit and the best way to master something is sharing it with the whole world, open source is the key to do so.
