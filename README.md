================================

&nbsp;

I am a Junior Full Stack Web Developer, passionate about test driven development end to end and best practices like BDD, TDD and OOP by doing pair programming.

Also, I am a Mechatronic engineer who love working with mobile robots and learning as much as possible about advanced maths and artificial intelligence.

I firmly believe that knowledge has no limit and the best way to master something is sharing it with the whole world, open source is the key to do so.
